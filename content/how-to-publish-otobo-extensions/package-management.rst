Package Management
==================

The OPM (OTOBO Package Manager) is a mechanism to distribute software packages for the OTOBO framework via HTTP, FTP or file upload.

For example, the OTOBO project offers OTOBO modules like a calendar, a file manager or web mail in OTOBO packages via online repositories on our FTP servers. The packages can be managed (install, upgrade and uninstall) via the admin interface.


Package Distribution
--------------------

If you want to create an OPM online repository, just tell the OTOBO framework where the location is by activating the system configuration setting ``Package::RepositoryList`` and adding the new location there. Then you will have a new select option in the package manager.

In your repository, create an index file for your OPM packages. OTOBO just reads this index file and knows what packages are available.

::

   shell> bin/otobo.Console.pl Dev::Package::RepositoryIndex /path/to/repository/ > /path/to/repository/otobo.xml


Package Commands
----------------

You can use the following OPM commands over the admin interface or over ``bin/otobo.Console.pl`` to manage admin jobs for OPM packages.
