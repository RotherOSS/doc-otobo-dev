About
======

This repository stores the source of the _OTOBO Development Guide_.

The content of the documentation is in [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) format and uses [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) to generate HTML, PDF and EPUB outputs.
The various outputs can be seen on the [OTOBO Documentation page](https://doc.otobo.org/).


🛠  Local Preview and Development
====================

To verify changes to the documentation before submitting them, you can generate a local HTML preview.
This helps identify syntax errors in ReStructuredText (RST) or layout issues early in the process.
